USB-Battery-Charger
===================

Rechargable AA and AAA batteries are handy, but charging them is a hassle.  You need to buy a larger charger that has to convert the high voltage wall outlet to 1.5V DC.  Usually these chargers suck.  They only have an LED to show when complete.  They do not show charging status.  

This will create a USB dongle that charges AA and AAA batteries.  The 5V USB buss will provide the charging current.  The computer it is hooked up to will be able to read the battery current and voltage. 

This will let me create a cheap and robust battery charger.
